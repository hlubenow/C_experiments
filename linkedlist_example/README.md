#### linkedlistexample 0.1

My attempt to implement a doubly linked list in C.
Such a list can be used to store different kind of elements (integers and strings at the moment), and it can be change dynamically, that is, elements can be easily added or removed lateron. Quite similar to the list datatypes found in Python and Perl. Using these kind of lists may make C-programming a lot easier, but it may have a speed penalty.

In the code, I'm also using my C-emulation of classes here.

Meant to be used in Linux. Enter `make` to compile.
